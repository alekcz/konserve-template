# konserve-template

This is a starter template it give basic guide lines on how to build a konserve backend.   
The source code is heavily annotated so go check it out. 

It's important to have a solid foundation when building a library. To help you keep your quality up you can run
- `lein test` to test your code
- `lein cloverage` to see the coverage of your tests. 

A github action has been provided to get you going. 

# Status

[Build status badge] [Coverage status badge]

## Prerequisites

List any prerequisites for setting up you backend. 

## Usage

_Link to the your lib on clojars_

`[your/store "x.y.z"]`

```clojure
(require '[konserve-yourstore.core :refer :all]
         '[clojure.core.async :refer [<!!] :as async]
         '[konserve.core :as k])
  
  (def your-store (<!! (new-your-store connection-uri :other-config "info" :and-more :yay)))

  (<!! (k/exists? your-store  "cecilia"))
  (<!! (k/get-in your-store ["cecilia"]))
  (<!! (k/assoc-in your-store ["cecilia"] 28))
  (<!! (k/update-in your-store ["cecilia"] inc))
  (<!! (k/get-in your-store ["cecilia"]))

  (defrecord Test [a])
  (<!! (k/assoc-in your-store ["agatha"] (Test. 35)))
  (<!! (k/get-in your-store ["agatha"]))
```
